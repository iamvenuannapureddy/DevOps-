<h1>EC2- Elastic Cloud Compute</h1>

When creating an **EC2-Elastic Cloud Compute** instance using Terraform, you need to specify various resource details and configurations for the instance. These specifications include attributes related to **instance type, networking, security, storage, and more**. Below are the key resource specifications to consider when creating an EC2 instance:

### 1. **AMI (Amazon Machine Image)**
   - **Key:** `ami`
   - Specifies the ID of the AMI to use for the instance. The AMI determines the operating system, installed software, and configuration.
   - Example:
     ```hcl
     ami = "ami-12345678"
     ```

### 2. **Instance Type**
   - **Key:** `instance_type`
   - Defines the EC2 instance type (e.g., `t2.micro`, `m5.large`), which determines the vCPU, memory, and network performance.
   - Example:
     ```hcl
     instance_type = "t2.micro"
     ```

### 3. **Key Pair**
   - **Key:** `key_name`
   - Specifies the name of the key pair to use for SSH access to the instance.
   - Example:
     ```hcl
     key_name = "my-key"
     ```

### 4. **Security Groups**
   - **Key:** `vpc_security_group_ids`
   - Specifies the security group IDs that control the inbound and outbound traffic to the instance.
   - Example:
     ```hcl
     vpc_security_group_ids = ["sg-12345678"]
     ```

### 5. **Subnet**
   - **Key:** `subnet_id`
   - Specifies the subnet in which to launch the instance. This determines the instance's placement in a VPC.
   - Example:
     ```hcl
     subnet_id = "subnet-12345678"
     ```

### 6. **Tags**
   - **Key:** `tags`
   - Assigns tags to the instance for identification and organization.
   - Example:
     ```hcl
     tags = {
       Name = "MyEC2Instance"
     }
     ```

### 7. **Block Device Mapping (Storage)**
   - **Key:** `root_block_device`, `ebs_block_device`
   - Specifies the block devices to attach to the instance, such as the root EBS volume and additional EBS volumes.
   - Example:
     ```hcl
     root_block_device {
       volume_size = 20
       volume_type = "gp2"
     }
     ```

### 8. **IAM Role and Instance Profile**
   - **Key:** `iam_instance_profile`
   - Specifies the IAM role to attach to the instance for granting AWS service access.
   - Example:
     ```hcl
     iam_instance_profile = "my-instance-profile"
     ```

### 9. **User Data**
   - **Key:** `user_data`
   - Provides a script or cloud-init configuration to run when the instance launches, often used for bootstrapping (installing packages, starting services).
   - Example:
     ```hcl
     user_data = <<-EOF
       #!/bin/bash
       yum install -y httpd
       systemctl start httpd
     EOF
     ```

### 10. **Elastic IP (Optional)**
   - **Key:** `associate_public_ip_address`
   - Specifies whether to assign a public IP to the instance.
   - Example:
     ```hcl
     associate_public_ip_address = true
     ```

### 11. **Monitoring**
   - **Key:** `monitoring`
   - Enables or disables detailed CloudWatch monitoring for the instance.
   - Example:
     ```hcl
     monitoring = true
     ```

### 12. **Availability Zone (AZ)**
   - **Key:** `availability_zone`
   - Specifies the AZ within the region where the instance should be launched.
   - Example:
     ```hcl
     availability_zone = "us-east-1a"
     ```

### 13. **Tenancy**
   - **Key:** `tenancy`
   - Specifies whether to run the instance on shared hardware (`default`) or dedicated hardware (`dedicated`).
   - Example:
     ```hcl
     tenancy = "default"
     ```

### 14. **Placement Group (Optional)**
   - **Key:** `placement_group`
   - Specifies the placement group in which to launch the instance, which can help with high network throughput between instances.
   - Example:
     ```hcl
     placement_group = "my-placement-group"
     ```

### 15. **Disable API Termination (Optional)**
   - **Key:** `disable_api_termination`
   - Prevents the instance from being terminated via the API (useful for protection).
   - Example:
     ```hcl
     disable_api_termination = true
     ```

### 16. **Private IP Address (Optional)**
   - **Key:** `private_ip`
   - Specifies a private IP address to assign to the instance.
   - Example:
     ```hcl
     private_ip = "10.0.1.5"
     ```

### Example Terraform Configuration for EC2
```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami                         = "ami-12345678"
  instance_type               = "t2.micro"
  key_name                    = "my-key"
  vpc_security_group_ids      = ["sg-12345678"]
  subnet_id                   = "subnet-12345678"
  iam_instance_profile        = "my-instance-profile"
  associate_public_ip_address = true
  monitoring                  = true

  root_block_device {
    volume_size = 20
    volume_type = "gp2"
  }

  tags = {
    Name = "MyEC2Instance"
  }

  user_data = <<-EOF
    #!/bin/bash
    yum install -y httpd
    systemctl start httpd
  EOF
}
```

These are the core specifications, but you can customize them further based on your projectâ€™s requirements.
