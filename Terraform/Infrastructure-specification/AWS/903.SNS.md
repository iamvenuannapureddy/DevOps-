<h1>SNS-Simple Notification Service</h1>

When creating an **Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service)** topic using Terraform, you need to understand several key resource specifications to configure topics, subscriptions, and permissions correctly. Below are the primary attributes and considerations when working with SNS in Terraform.


### **Key Resource Specifications for Amazon SNS**

1. **SNS Topic**
2. **Topic Name**
3. **Display Name**
4. **Policy**
5. **Delivery Policy**
6. **KMS Master Key ID (Encryption)**
7. **Tags**
8. **Subscriptions**
9. **Dead-Letter Queue (Optional)**
10. **Message Filtering (Optional)**

---

### 1. **SNS Topic**

The primary resource for creating an SNS topic is `aws_sns_topic`.

#### Example:

```hcl
resource "aws_sns_topic" "example" {
  name = "example-topic"
}
```

---

### 2. **Topic Name**

- **Key:** `name`
- **Description:** The name of the SNS topic. If not specified, Terraform will generate a unique name.

#### Example:

```hcl
name = "my-sns-topic"
```

---

### 3. **Display Name**

- **Key:** `display_name`
- **Description:** A human-readable name used in the **From** field for SMS and email notifications.

#### Example:

```hcl
display_name = "My SNSTopic"
```

---

### 4. **Policy**

- **Key:** `policy`
- **Description:** An IAM policy in JSON that defines who can interact with the SNS topic. This controls publishing and subscribing permissions.

#### Example:

```hcl
policy = <<POLICY
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Id": "__default_policy_ID",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "__default_statement_ID",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "*"
      },
      "Action": "SNS:Publish",
      "Resource": "${aws_sns_topic.example.arn}"
    }
  ]
}
POLICY
```

---

### 5. **Delivery Policy**

- **Key:** `delivery_policy`
- **Description:** A JSON policy that defines how Amazon SNS retries the delivery of messages to HTTP/S endpoints.

#### Example:

```hcl
delivery_policy = <<POLICY
{
  "http": {
    "defaultHealthyRetryPolicy": {
      "numRetries": 3,
      "minDelayTarget": 20,
      "maxDelayTarget": 20,
      "numMaxDelayRetries": 0,
      "numNoDelayRetries": 0,
      "numMinDelayRetries": 0,
      "backoffFunction": "linear"
    },
    "disableSubscriptionOverrides": false
  }
}
POLICY
```

---

### 6. **KMS Master Key ID (Encryption)**

- **Key:** `kms_master_key_id`
- **Description:** The ARN of a KMS key for server-side encryption of messages.

#### Example:

```hcl
kms_master_key_id = "arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456789012:key/your-key-id"
```

---

### 7. **Tags**

- **Key:** `tags`
- **Description:** A map of tags to assign to the resource.

#### Example:

```hcl
tags = {
  Environment = "Production"
  Team        = "DevOps"
}
```

---

### 8. **Subscriptions**

Subscriptions can be created using the `aws_sns_topic_subscription` resource. This allows you to subscribe endpoints (like email, SQS, Lambda) to the topic.

#### Example:

```hcl
resource "aws_sns_topic_subscription" "example_email" {
  topic_arn = aws_sns_topic.example.arn
  protocol  = "email"
  endpoint  = "user@example.com"
}

resource "aws_sns_topic_subscription" "example_sqs" {
  topic_arn = aws_sns_topic.example.arn
  protocol  = "sqs"
  endpoint  = aws_sqs_queue.example_queue.arn
}
```

**Key Attributes:**

- `topic_arn`: ARN of the SNS topic.
- `protocol`: The protocol to use (e.g., `email`, `sms`, `sqs`, `lambda`, `http`, `https`).
- `endpoint`: The endpoint to receive notifications.

---

### 9. **Dead-Letter Queue (Optional)**

Configure a dead-letter queue (DLQ) for messages that fail to be delivered.

#### Steps:

1. **Create an SQS Queue:**

   ```hcl
   resource "aws_sqs_queue" "dlq" {
     name = "sns-dlq"
   }
   ```

2. **Set Redrive Policy in SNS Topic:**

   ```hcl
   resource "aws_sns_topic" "example" {
     name = "example-topic"

     redrive_policy = jsonencode({
       deadLetterTargetArn = aws_sqs_queue.dlq.arn
     })
   }
   ```

---

### 10. **Message Filtering (Optional)**

Allows subscribers to receive only a subset of messages based on message attributes.

#### Example:

**Add Subscription with Filter Policy:**

```hcl
resource "aws_sns_topic_subscription" "filtered_subscription" {
  topic_arn = aws_sns_topic.example.arn
  protocol  = "sqs"
  endpoint  = aws_sqs_queue.filtered_queue.arn

  filter_policy = jsonencode({
    eventType = ["order_placed", "order_cancelled"]
  })
}
```

---

### **Complete Example**

```hcl
# SNS Topic
resource "aws_sns_topic" "example" {
  name         = "my-sns-topic"
  display_name = "My SNSTopic"

  kms_master_key_id = "arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456789012:key/your-key-id"

  tags = {
    Environment = "Production"
    Team        = "DevOps"
  }
}

# SQS Queue for DLQ
resource "aws_sqs_queue" "dlq" {
  name = "sns-dlq"
}

# SNS Topic with Redrive Policy
resource "aws_sns_topic" "example_with_dlq" {
  name = "my-sns-topic-with-dlq"

  redrive_policy = jsonencode({
    deadLetterTargetArn = aws_sqs_queue.dlq.arn
  })
}

# Email Subscription
resource "aws_sns_topic_subscription" "email_sub" {
  topic_arn = aws_sns_topic.example.arn
  protocol  = "email"
  endpoint  = "user@example.com"
}

# SQS Subscription with Filter Policy
resource "aws_sns_topic_subscription" "sqs_sub" {
  topic_arn = aws_sns_topic.example.arn
  protocol  = "sqs"
  endpoint  = aws_sqs_queue.example_queue.arn

  filter_policy = jsonencode({
    eventType = ["order_placed", "order_shipped"]
  })
}

# SQS Queue for Subscription
resource "aws_sqs_queue" "example_queue" {
  name = "sns-subscription-queue"
}

# SQS Queue Policy to Allow SNS to Send Messages
resource "aws_sqs_queue_policy" "sqs_policy" {
  queue_url = aws_sqs_queue.example_queue.id

  policy = data.aws_iam_policy_document.sqs_policy.json
}

# IAM Policy Document for SQS Queue Policy
data "aws_iam_policy_document" "sqs_policy" {
  statement {
    effect = "Allow"

    principals {
      type        = "Service"
      identifiers = ["sns.amazonaws.com"]
    }

    actions = ["sqs:SendMessage"]

    resources = [aws_sqs_queue.example_queue.arn]

    condition {
      test     = "ArnEquals"
      variable = "aws:SourceArn"
      values   = [aws_sns_topic.example.arn]
    }
  }
}
```

### **Key Considerations**

- **Protocols:** Ensure the protocol and endpoint are valid. For email and SMS, manual confirmation might be required.

- **Permissions:** When integrating SNS with other AWS services (e.g., SQS, Lambda), set appropriate permissions and policies.

- **Encryption:** Use KMS keys for encrypting messages if your application requires it.

- **Dead-Letter Queues:** Configure DLQs to handle undelivered messages and avoid message loss.

- **Filtering:** Use message filtering to control which subscribers receive specific messages based on attributes.

- **Confirmation:** Some subscriptions require endpoint confirmation (e.g., email), so plan for that in your workflow.

---

### **Summary**

When creating SNS resources using Terraform, you need to:

- **Define SNS Topics:** Using `aws_sns_topic`, specify names, display names, policies, and encryption settings.

- **Create Subscriptions:** Using `aws_sns_topic_subscription`, define how messages are delivered to endpoints.

- **Set Permissions:** Ensure that necessary permissions are in place, especially when SNS interacts with other AWS services.

- **Configure Advanced Settings:** Utilize features like DLQs and message filtering to enhance reliability and control.

By carefully specifying these resources and their attributes, you can effectively manage SNS topics and subscriptions within your Terraform configurations, ensuring robust and reliable messaging for your applications.
