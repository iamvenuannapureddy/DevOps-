<h1>Dockerfile</h1>

A Dockerfile is a text file containing instructions to build a Docker image. Let’s go through the common Dockerfile instructions step by step with examples:

### 1. FROM

Specifies the base image for the Docker image.
	•	Syntax: FROM <image>:<tag>
	•	Purpose: Defines the starting point for the image.

Example:

FROM python:3.9-slim

	•	This uses the lightweight Python 3.9 slim image as the base.

### 2. LABEL

Adds metadata to the image.
	•	Syntax: LABEL key="value"
	•	Purpose: Useful for documentation or tracking.

Example:

LABEL maintainer="your_email@example.com"
LABEL version="1.0"

	•	Adds metadata like the maintainer and version.

3. RUN

Executes commands to build the image (e.g., install dependencies).
	•	Syntax: RUN <command>
	•	Purpose: Runs shell commands during the build process.

Example:

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl

	•	Updates the package list and installs curl.

4. WORKDIR

Sets the working directory inside the container.
	•	Syntax: WORKDIR <path>
	•	Purpose: All subsequent instructions like RUN, CMD, or COPY use this directory as the working context.

Example:

WORKDIR /app

	•	Sets /app as the working directory.

5. COPY

Copies files from the host to the container.
	•	Syntax: COPY <source> <destination>
	•	Purpose: Transfers files into the container’s filesystem.

Example:

COPY requirements.txt /app/requirements.txt

	•	Copies requirements.txt from the host to /app in the container.

6. ADD

Similar to COPY but supports additional features like extracting archives.
	•	Syntax: ADD <source> <destination>
	•	Purpose: Transfers files or downloads URLs into the container.

Example:

ADD https://example.com/config.tar.gz /app/config.tar.gz

	•	Downloads and places the config.tar.gz file in /app.

7. CMD

Specifies the default command to run when the container starts.
	•	Syntax: CMD ["executable", "arg1", "arg2"]
	•	Purpose: Defines the primary process for the container.

Example:

CMD ["python", "app.py"]

	•	Runs the Python application app.py when the container starts.

8. ENTRYPOINT

Similar to CMD, but allows additional arguments to be passed at runtime.
	•	Syntax: ENTRYPOINT ["executable", "arg1"]
	•	Purpose: Defines the executable that always runs, even if extra commands are passed.

Example:

ENTRYPOINT ["python"]
CMD ["app.py"]

	•	Defaults to python app.py but allows overriding the script name (python another_script.py).

9. ENV

Sets environment variables in the container.
	•	Syntax: ENV <key> <value>
	•	Purpose: Passes configuration values.

Example:

ENV FLASK_ENV=production

	•	Sets the FLASK_ENV variable to production.

10. EXPOSE

Documents the port(s) the container will listen on.
	•	Syntax: EXPOSE <port>
	•	Purpose: Declares the container’s listening ports.

Example:

EXPOSE 8080

	•	Declares that the container listens on port 8080.

11. VOLUME

Creates a mount point for persistent data.
	•	Syntax: VOLUME ["<path>"]
	•	Purpose: Specifies directories to persist data or share with the host.

Example:

VOLUME ["/data"]

	•	Sets /data as a volume.

12. ARG

Defines build-time variables.
	•	Syntax: ARG <name>=<default>
	•	Purpose: Provides variables during the image build.

Example:

ARG APP_VERSION=1.0

	•	Defines a build argument APP_VERSION.

13. USER

Specifies the user for running commands.
	•	Syntax: USER <username>
	•	Purpose: Enhances security by avoiding root.

Example:

USER appuser

	•	Switches to appuser.

14. ONBUILD

Defines triggers for child images.
	•	Syntax: ONBUILD <instruction>
	•	Purpose: Runs the instruction in any derived Dockerfile.

Example:

ONBUILD RUN echo "This is a trigger"

	•	Executes in images derived from this one.

15. HEALTHCHECK

Monitors the health of the container.
	•	Syntax: HEALTHCHECK [OPTIONS] CMD <command>
	•	Purpose: Periodically checks the container’s health.

Example:

HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s CMD curl -f http://localhost || exit 1

	•	Checks if the application is running on localhost.

16. SHELL

Specifies the shell to use for RUN commands.
	•	Syntax: SHELL ["executable", "arg1"]
	•	Purpose: Changes the default shell (e.g., from /bin/sh to /bin/bash).

Example:

SHELL ["/bin/bash", "-c"]

	•	Uses Bash instead of the default shell.

Example Dockerfile

FROM python:3.9-slim
LABEL maintainer="your_email@example.com"
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt /app/
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . /app
EXPOSE 5000
ENV FLASK_ENV=production
CMD ["python", "app.py"]

This Dockerfile:
	1.	Uses Python 3.9 slim as the base.
	2.	Sets metadata.
	3.	Sets /app as the working directory.
	4.	Copies dependencies and installs them.
	5.	Exposes port 5000.
	6.	Sets an environment variable.
	7.	Runs the Flask app.
