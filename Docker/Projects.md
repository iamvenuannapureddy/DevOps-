### 7. **Docker with Microservices**
   - **Goal**: Containerize and deploy a microservices-based architecture.
   - **Steps**:
     - Develop multiple microservices (e.g., a frontend service, backend service, and database) and containerize each one.
     - Use Docker Compose or Kubernetes to define and manage all microservices.
     - Implement service discovery and scaling between the microservices.
     - Example: Build a microservices architecture for an e-commerce app (frontend, payment service, and inventory service) using Docker Compose.

### 8. **Dockerized Machine Learning Model Deployment**
   - **Goal**: Deploy a machine learning model using Docker.
   - **Steps**:
     - Train a machine learning model in Python (e.g., with scikit-learn or TensorFlow).
     - Create a Flask API that serves the model for predictions.
     - Write a `Dockerfile` to containerize the model and the Flask API.
     - Build and run the Docker container, exposing an API endpoint for inference.
     - Example: Deploy a trained image classification model using Docker and expose it through an API for real-time predictions.

### 9. **Serverless Deployment with Docker and AWS Lambda**
   - **Goal**: Package a serverless function using Docker for AWS Lambda.
   - **Steps**:
     - Write an AWS Lambda function in Python, Node.js, or another supported language.
     - Create a Docker image based on AWS Lambda base images.
     - Push the Docker image to AWS ECR and deploy it to Lambda using the container image support.
     - Example: Package a serverless Lambda function for image processing using Docker and deploy it on AWS Lambda.

### 10. **Monitoring and Logging for Docker Containers**
   - **Goal**: Set up monitoring and logging for Docker containers.
   - **Steps**:
     - Install and configure Prometheus and Grafana to monitor resource usage (CPU, memory, etc.) in Docker containers.
     - Use ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack for logging and monitoring logs from Docker containers.
