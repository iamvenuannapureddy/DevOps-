Prometheus and Grafana are widely used in the following tools and technologies:

### **DevOps & CI/CD Tools:**
- Kubernetes (K8s)
- Docker
- Jenkins
- GitLab CI/CD
- ArgoCD

### **Cloud Platforms:**
- AWS (CloudWatch, EKS)
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- Microsoft Azure
- OpenStack

### **Infrastructure & Monitoring:**
- Terraform
- Ansible
- Nagios
- Zabbix

### **Logging and Metrics:**
- Elastic Stack (ELK)
- Fluentd
- Loki (by Grafana)

### **Application Development:**
- Spring Boot (Micrometer integration)
- Node.js (Prometheus libraries)
- Python (Prometheus client libraries)

These technologies use Prometheus for metrics collection and alerting, and Grafana for data visualization.

Here's how **Prometheus** and **Grafana** are used in the mentioned tools and technologies:

---

### **1. DevOps & CI/CD Tools:**
- **Kubernetes (K8s):**  
  - Prometheus monitors the cluster metrics such as pod CPU, memory, and network usage.  
  - Grafana visualizes Kubernetes metrics using dashboards for cluster health and performance.

- **Docker:**  
  - Prometheus collects container-level metrics like uptime, resource utilization, and logs.  
  - Grafana visualizes container metrics for monitoring containerized applications.

- **Jenkins:**  
  - Prometheus plugin fetches build, job, and pipeline performance data.  
  - Grafana displays CI/CD pipeline health and build success rates in dashboards.

- **GitLab CI/CD:**  
  - Prometheus collects metrics from GitLab runners and pipelines.  
  - Grafana shows pipeline duration, error rates, and runner statistics.

- **ArgoCD:**  
  - Prometheus monitors deployment success, resource usage, and application health.  
  - Grafana dashboards help observe ArgoCD performance and audit trails.

### **2. Cloud Platforms:**
- **AWS (CloudWatch, EKS):**  
  - Prometheus scrapes metrics from Amazon services like EKS using exporters.  
  - Grafana integrates with CloudWatch to display AWS resource utilization.

- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP):**  
  - Prometheus collects metrics from GKE and other GCP services.  
  - Grafana visualizes these metrics alongside custom application data.

- **Microsoft Azure:**  
  - Azure Monitor integrates with Prometheus for metrics ingestion.  
  - Grafana provides dashboards for Azure resources like VMs, AKS, and SQL databases.

- **OpenStack:**  
  - Prometheus tracks OpenStack services (Nova, Neutron, etc.) using OpenStack exporters.  
  - Grafana visualizes OpenStack infrastructure metrics.

---

### **3. Infrastructure & Monitoring:**
- **Terraform:**  
  - Prometheus monitors Terraform deployment health and execution times using custom exporters.  
  - Grafana shows deployment timelines and resource provisioning stats.

- **Ansible:**  
  - Prometheus gathers metrics on Ansible playbook execution via exporters.  
  - Grafana displays playbook performance and success rates.

- **Nagios:**  
  - Prometheus bridges with Nagios for advanced time-series data collection.  
  - Grafana displays Nagios data with improved visualizations.

- **Zabbix:**  
  - Prometheus scrapes Zabbix-exported metrics for modern monitoring.  
  - Grafana enhances Zabbix metrics visualization.

---

### **4. Logging and Metrics:**
- **Elastic Stack (ELK):**  
  - Prometheus collects system and application metrics alongside logs from Elasticsearch.  
  - Grafana visualizes the combined logs and metrics for better insights.

- **Fluentd:**  
  - Prometheus gathers Fluentd logs and pipeline performance metrics.  
  - Grafana shows metrics like throughput and error rates.

- **Loki (by Grafana):**  
  - Prometheus provides complementary metric data for Loki log aggregation.  
  - Grafana correlates logs and metrics in unified dashboards.

---

### **5. Application Development:**
- **Spring Boot (Micrometer):**  
  - Prometheus gathers application metrics using the Micrometer library.  
  - Grafana visualizes business logic metrics like API response times.

- **Node.js:**  
  - Prometheus fetches runtime metrics using Node.js Prometheus client libraries.  
  - Grafana visualizes performance and error metrics.

- **Python:**  
  - Prometheus collects application-level metrics using Python client libraries.  
  - Grafana creates dashboards for Python application monitoring.

---

In all these scenarios, **Prometheus** is the primary tool for collecting, storing, and querying metrics, while **Grafana** provides interactive and customizable dashboards for visualization. This combination ensures robust monitoring and alerting for system health and performance.
