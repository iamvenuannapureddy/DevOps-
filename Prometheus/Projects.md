   - **Goal**: Monitor network performance using Prometheus and visualize metrics in Grafana.
   - **Steps**:
     - Use a network exporter (e.g., `node_exporter`, `snmp_exporter`) to gather metrics such as bandwidth usage, packet loss, and network latency.
     - Configure Prometheus to scrape network metrics and Grafana to visualize them.
     - Create dashboards for bandwidth usage, packet loss, and latency across different network segments.
     - Example: Monitor the bandwidth utilization of a Kubernetes clusterâ€™s nodes and visualize network latency and packet loss in Grafana.

### 8. **Full Stack Monitoring (Frontend, Backend, and Database)**
   - **Goal**: Implement end-to-end monitoring of a full-stack application, including frontend, backend, and database layers.
   - **Steps**:
     - Instrument the frontend (e.g., using a client-side Prometheus exporter) to capture browser metrics like page load times.
     - Monitor backend APIs with Prometheus to track response times, error rates, and request volume.
     - Monitor the database using a Prometheus exporter to track query performance and resource usage.
