<h1>Project: Deploy a Java Web Application on AWS Cloud</h1>

Below is an end-to-end project explanation for building and deploying a Java web application on AWS using Elastic Beanstalk and other AWS services. This guide will cover the architecture, tools, and steps to complete the project.

---

### **Overview**
This project involves deploying a Java web application using AWS Elastic Beanstalk and integrating additional AWS services for a scalable, secure, and efficient architecture.

---

### **Architecture**
The architecture consists of:
1. **Application Layer**:
   - Java Web Application built using JDK 17 and Maven.
   - Storing artifact on S3 Buckets.
2. **Networking**:
   - **VPC**: Custom VPC for isolated network configuration.
3. **Security**:
   - **IAM Roles/Policies**: Secure access management.
   - **Security Groups**: Firewall configurations.
4. **Database Layer**:
   - **Amazon RDS** for relational database management.
5. **Messaging Layer**:
   - **Amazon MQ (RabbitMQ)** for message brokering.
6. **Caching Layer**:
   - **Elastic Cache (Memcached)** for in-memory caching.
7. **Deplyment layer**
   - Deployed on **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**.
   - **ALB**: Application Load Balancer for traffic distribution.
   - **ASG**: Auto Scaling Group for scalability.
8. **Storage**:
   - **S3 Buckets**: Static content and artifact storage.
   - **CloudFront**: Content Delivery Network (CDN) for S3 bucket.
9. **Domain Management**:
   - **Route 53**: Custom domain setup.
10. **Monitoring**:
   - **CloudWatch**: Application performance monitoring. 

---

### **Tools**
- **JDK 17**: For application development.
- **Maven**: For build and dependency management.
- **VS Code**: Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
- **GitHub**: For version control.
- **AWS CLI**: For managing AWS resources.

### **Step-by-Step Implementation**

#### **1. Develop the Java Web Application**
1. **Set up a Maven project**:
   ```bash
   mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.example -DartifactId=myapp -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-webapp -DinteractiveMode=false
   ```
2. **Write code**: Develop the application logic in the `src/main` directory.
3. **Configure `pom.xml`**:
   Add dependencies like `spring-boot`, `jackson`, or any frameworks you are using.
4. **Build the artifact**:
   ```bash
   mvn clean package
   ```

#### **2. Store the Artifact in S3**
1. **Upload JAR/WAR to S3**:
   ```bash
   aws s3 cp target/myapp.war s3://myapp-artifacts/
   ```

#### **3. Configure the AWS Services**
1. **Set up the VPC**:
   - Create a VPC with public and private subnets.
   - Configure **NAT Gateway** and **Internet Gateway** for outbound traffic.

2. **Set up RDS**:
   - Launch an Amazon RDS instance with a MySQL/PostgreSQL database.
   - Configure security groups to allow access only from the Elastic Beanstalk environment.

3. **Set up Elastic Cache (Memcached)**:
   - Deploy Elastic Cache for in-memory caching.
   - Attach the cache to your application in the configuration.

4. **Set up Amazon MQ**:
   - Launch a RabbitMQ broker.
   - Use it for asynchronous communication between services.

5. **Elastic Beanstalk**:
   - Create an Elastic Beanstalk environment.
   - Use the uploaded artifact from S3 to deploy the application.
   - Choose **Tomcat** as the platform if using a WAR file.

6. **Configure Load Balancer and Auto Scaling**:
   - Use Elastic Beanstalk to automatically configure the **ALB** and **ASG**.

#### **4. Integrate Networking and Security**
1. **Route 53**:
   - Register a domain or configure an existing one.
   - Point it to the Elastic Beanstalk environment using an **ALIAS record**.
2. **IAM**:
   - Create roles for Elastic Beanstalk, RDS, and other AWS services.
3. **Security Groups**:
   - Configure rules to allow specific inbound/outbound traffic (e.g., ALB to EC2).

#### **5. Configure Monitoring**
1. **Set up CloudWatch Alarms**:
   - Monitor CPU utilization, memory usage, and error logs.
   - Configure notifications (via SNS) for threshold breaches.

#### **6. Optimize Storage and Delivery**
1. **S3 Bucket**:
   - Store static assets like images, JS, and CSS files.
2. **CloudFront**:
   - Distribute S3 content with reduced latency.

### **Verification and Testing**
1. **Verify Deployment**:
   - Access the application using the Elastic Beanstalk endpoint or custom domain.
2. **Test Features**:
   - Verify database connectivity, caching performance, and message brokering.
3. **Stress Test**:
   - Use tools like **Apache JMeter** to simulate high traffic.

### **Project Documentation for Resume**
**Project Title**: Deploying a Scalable Java Web Application on AWS  
**Technologies**: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Elastic Cache, Amazon MQ, RDS, S3, CloudFront, CloudWatch, JDK 17, Maven  
**Description**: Developed and deployed a Java-based web application using AWS Elastic Beanstalk. Integrated caching, messaging, and a relational database for optimized performance and scalability.  
**Key Contributions**:  
- Built a CI/CD pipeline to deploy the application artifact from GitHub to Elastic Beanstalk.  
- Configured AWS Elastic Cache for reducing latency by 50%.  
- Designed a fault-tolerant architecture using ALB, ASG, and multi-AZ RDS.  
- Optimized user access via Route 53 and CloudFront for faster content delivery.  
**Results**:  
- Improved application load time by 30%.  
- Achieved 99.9% availability with auto-scaling and monitoring.
