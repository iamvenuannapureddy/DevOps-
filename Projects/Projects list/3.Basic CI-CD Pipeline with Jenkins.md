<h1>Basic CI-CD Pipeline with Jenkins</h1>

Setting up a basic CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins automates the build, test, and deployment stages for a project, ensuring faster feedback and code quality. Below is an outline for creating a simple Jenkins CI/CD pipeline.

### Project Overview

**Objective:** Set up a Jenkins pipeline to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying an application.

**Pipeline Stages:**
1. **Build**: Compiles the code and installs dependencies.
2. **Test**: Runs automated tests to verify code correctness.
3. **Deploy**: Deploys the application to a staging or production environment.

### Tools and Technologies

- **Jenkins**: For continuous integration and continuous deployment.
- **Source Code Management (SCM)**: Git (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket).
- **Build Tool**: For example, Maven (Java), NPM (JavaScript), or Gradle.
- **Testing Framework**: JUnit (Java), Jest (JavaScript), etc.
- **Deployment Server**: AWS, Docker, or another environment for deployment.

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. **Set Up Jenkins**

1. **Install Jenkins**:
   - Download and install Jenkins from [jenkins.io](https://www.jenkins.io/download/).
   - Start Jenkins on your machine or server.

2. **Set Up Required Plugins**:
   - Go to **Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins** and install plugins for:
     - **Git Plugin** for source control.
     - **Pipeline Plugin** for defining pipelines.
     - **Maven Integration Plugin** (if using Maven for builds).
     - **Docker Plugin** (if deploying with Docker).
   
3. **Create Jenkins User and Set Up Security**:
   - Go to **Manage Jenkins > Configure Global Security** to set up access control, enabling project security and setting up user accounts.

#### 2. **Create a Git Repository for Your Application**

1. **Initialize a Git Repository** for your project, or use an existing one.
2. **Push the Code** to GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
3. **Connect Jenkins to the Repository**:
   - Go to **Manage Jenkins > Configure System** and add credentials for the repository if it’s private.

#### 3. **Configure a Jenkins Pipeline Job**

1. **Create a New Pipeline Job**:
   - Go to **New Item** in Jenkins, enter a name, and select **Pipeline**.

2. **Configure Pipeline Job**:
   - In the **Pipeline** section, specify the Git repository under **Pipeline script from SCM** and choose **Git** as the SCM.
   - Enter the repository URL and branch details.

#### 4. **Write the Jenkinsfile**

The `Jenkinsfile` is a script defining each step of the CI/CD pipeline. Place it in the root of your Git repository.

Here’s an example of a simple Jenkinsfile:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                // Clone the repository
                git branch: 'main', url: 'https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git'
            }
        }

        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                // Install dependencies and compile code (example for Node.js)
                sh 'npm install'
                sh 'npm run build'
            }
        }

        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                // Run unit tests
                sh 'npm test'
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                // Example deployment with Docker
                script {
                    // Build Docker image
                    sh 'docker build -t your-username/your-app:latest .'
                    // Push Docker image to Docker Hub
                    sh 'docker push your-username/your-app:latest'
                    // Run container (if deploying to a Docker environment)
                    sh 'docker run -d -p 80:80 your-username/your-app:latest'
                }
            }
        }
    }

    post {
        always {
            // Clean workspace after build completion
            cleanWs()
        }
        success {
            // Notify success (e.g., email or Slack, if configured)
            echo 'Build and deploy successful!'
        }
        failure {
            // Notify failure
            echo 'Build or deployment failed.'
        }
    }
}
```

#### 5. **Pipeline Stages Explained**

1. **Checkout**:
   - Pulls the code from the specified Git branch.

2. **Build**:
   - Installs dependencies and compiles the code. This example uses `npm install` and `npm run build`, which are typical commands for JavaScript projects. Replace with the appropriate build commands for your project.

3. **Test**:
   - Executes unit tests to verify the functionality. This example uses `npm test`, but any other test command can be used (e.g., `mvn test` for Maven).

4. **Deploy**:
   - Builds a Docker image and pushes it to Docker Hub. It then starts a container based on the built image, mapping it to port 80. You can adapt the deployment step to your specific environment, whether it’s AWS, Kubernetes, or another environment.

5. **Post Actions**:
   - Defines actions based on the pipeline’s result:
     - **always**: Executes regardless of success or failure, ensuring the workspace is cleaned up.
     - **success**: Sends a success notification (e.g., Slack, email).
     - **failure**: Sends a failure notification.

#### 6. **Configure Webhook (Optional)**

To automate triggering builds on Git push:

1. Go to your GitHub repository settings.
2. Go to **Webhooks > Add webhook**.
3. Enter the Jenkins URL followed by `/github-webhook/` (e.g., `http://your-jenkins-url/github-webhook/`).
4. Choose **Just the push event** to trigger on pushes only.

#### 7. **Run the Pipeline**

1. Go to **Build Now** in Jenkins to manually trigger the pipeline.
2. Review the build logs under **Console Output**.
3. Confirm the pipeline stages executed successfully and your application was deployed.

### Final Thoughts

This setup provides an automated CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins, which builds, tests, and deploys code changes to your environment. Over time, you can extend this pipeline by adding more stages, notifications, or deployments to other environments. For more advanced deployments, consider using Kubernetes, Blue-Green Deployments, and Canary Releases.
