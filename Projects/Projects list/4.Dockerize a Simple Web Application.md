<H1>Dockerizing a simple web application</H1>

Dockerizing a simple web application involves creating a Docker image that packages the application and its dependencies so it can be run consistently on any platform. Here’s a step-by-step guide to Dockerize a Node.js web application as an example.

---

### Project Overview

**Objective:** Dockerize a simple Node.js web application.

**Tools and Technologies:**
- **Node.js**: For building a basic web application.
- **Docker**: For containerizing the application.

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. **Set Up a Simple Node.js Web Application**

1. **Initialize the Project**:
   - Create a project directory, then navigate into it and initialize the Node.js project:
     ```bash
     mkdir dockerized-app
     cd dockerized-app
     npm init -y
     ```

2. **Install Express**:
   - Install Express to create a basic web server:
     ```bash
     npm install express
     ```

3. **Create the Application Code**:
   - Create an `app.js` file with a basic web server setup:
     ```javascript
     // app.js
     const express = require('express');
     const app = express();
     const port = 3000;

     app.get('/', (req, res) => {
       res.send('Hello, Dockerized World!');
     });

     app.listen(port, () => {
       console.log(`App running at http://localhost:${port}`);
     });
     ```

4. **Test the Application Locally**:
   - Run the application to ensure it works as expected:
     ```bash
     node app.js
     ```
   - Open a browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see the message: **"Hello, Dockerized World!"**.

#### 2. **Create a Dockerfile**

A Dockerfile contains instructions for building a Docker image of the application.

1. **Create a Dockerfile** in the root directory of the project with the following content:
   ```dockerfile
   # Use an official Node.js runtime as the base image
   FROM node:14

   # Create and set the working directory
   WORKDIR /app

   # Copy package.json and package-lock.json (if available)
   COPY package*.json ./

   # Install dependencies
   RUN npm install

   # Copy the rest of the application code
   COPY . .

   # Expose the application port
   EXPOSE 3000

   # Run the application
   CMD ["node", "app.js"]
   ```

#### Explanation of the Dockerfile

- `FROM node:14`: Uses the official Node.js image (version 14) as the base image.
- `WORKDIR /app`: Sets `/app` as the working directory within the container.
- `COPY package*.json ./`: Copies the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files to the working directory.
- `RUN npm install`: Installs dependencies based on the `package.json`.
- `COPY . .`: Copies the rest of the application code to the working directory.
- `EXPOSE 3000`: Exposes port 3000, which the app uses to listen for incoming connections.
- `CMD ["node", "app.js"]`: Specifies the command to run the application when the container starts.

#### 3. **Build the Docker Image**

1. Run the following command to build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t dockerized-app .
   ```

2. **Verify the Image**:
   - Once built, you can list your Docker images to verify it’s created:
     ```bash
     docker images
     ```

#### 4. **Run the Docker Container**

1. **Start a Container from the Image**:
   - Run the following command to start a new container based on the image:
     ```bash
     docker run -p 3000:3000 dockerized-app
     ```

2. **Access the Application**:
   - Open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see the message **"Hello, Dockerized World!"**.

   The `-p 3000:3000` option maps port 3000 on the host machine to port 3000 in the container, making the app accessible at `localhost:3000`.

#### 5. **Stopping and Managing Containers**

1. **List Running Containers**:
   - You can view running containers with:
     ```bash
     docker ps
     ```

2. **Stop the Container**:
   - To stop the container, use:
     ```bash
     docker stop <container_id>
     ```

3. **Remove the Container** (if needed):
   - To remove the stopped container, use:
     ```bash
     docker rm <container_id>
     ```

#### 6. **Push the Image to Docker Hub (Optional)**

To make your Docker image available for others or deploy it in a different environment, you can push it to Docker Hub.

1. **Log in to Docker Hub**:
   ```bash
   docker login
   ```

2. **Tag the Image**:
   - Replace `your-username` with your Docker Hub username:
     ```bash
     docker tag dockerized-app your-username/dockerized-app
     ```

3. **Push the Image**:
   ```bash
   docker push your-username/dockerized-app
   ```

Now, anyone with Docker installed can pull and run your app using:
```bash
docker pull your-username/dockerized-app
docker run -p 3000:3000 your-username/dockerized-app
```

### Final Thoughts

This simple project demonstrates how to Dockerize a basic web application, allowing it to run consistently in any environment that supports Docker. With further development, you can expand this by adding multi-stage builds, volume mounting for data persistence, or integrating the image into a CI/CD pipeline for continuous deployment.
