     - Example: Set up Prometheus and Grafana to monitor a Python Flask app’s performance metrics and create alerts based on thresholds.

### 11. **Blue-Green Deployment with Kubernetes**
   - **Goal**: Implement blue-green deployment to minimize downtime during updates.
   - **Steps**:
     - Deploy two versions of your application (blue and green) to the same Kubernetes cluster.
     - Use a LoadBalancer or Ingress to switch traffic between the versions.
     - Example: Perform a blue-green deployment for a Node.js app, allowing users to switch between old and new versions without downtime.

### 12. **Canary Deployment with Kubernetes**
   - **Goal**: Implement canary deployments to gradually release new features.
   - **Steps**:
     - Deploy a new version of your application alongside the current version.
