<h1>Kubernetes (K8s) projects</h1>

 list of **Kubernetes project ideas** ranging from beginner to expert levels:

---

### **Beginner Level**
1. **Deploy a Single Pod**  
   - Create and deploy a basic `nginx` or `httpd` pod using a YAML manifest.  
   - Access the pod using `kubectl port-forward`.

2. **Deploy a Multi-Container Pod**  
   - Deploy a pod with two containers (e.g., a web server and a sidecar for logging).  
   - Share a volume between the containers.

3. **Basic Service for Pod Access**  
   - Expose a pod using a `ClusterIP` service.  
   - Test the service within the cluster.

4. **ConfigMap and Secret Usage**  
   - Use a `ConfigMap` for environment variables in a pod.  
   - Mount a `Secret` as a volume for sensitive data like API keys.

5. **ReplicaSet Deployment**  
   - Deploy an application with multiple replicas using a `ReplicaSet`.  
   - Test scaling the replicas up and down.

6. **Namespace Management**  
   - Create and use separate namespaces for different applications.  
   - Deploy resources in the custom namespace.

### **Intermediate Level**
7. **Deploy a Web Application with Ingress**  
   - Deploy a web application and expose it using an `Ingress` resource.  
   - Use a custom domain for routing.

8. **Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)**  
   - Deploy an application and configure HPA based on CPU usage.  
   - Stress-test the application to observe auto-scaling in action.

9. **Persistent Storage with PVC and PV**  
   - Deploy an application that uses a `PersistentVolumeClaim` to store data.  
   - Use a hostPath or dynamic provisioning for storage.

10. **Rolling Updates and Rollbacks**  
    - Deploy an application using a `Deployment`.  
    - Simulate a rolling update and rollback using `kubectl`.

11. **Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana**  
    - Deploy Prometheus and Grafana on Kubernetes.  
    - Visualize application metrics in Grafana dashboards.

12. **Logging with Fluentd and Elasticsearch**  
    - Set up a centralized logging stack with Fluentd and Elasticsearch.  
    - Collect logs from all pods in the cluster.

---

### **Advanced Level**
13. **CI/CD Pipeline with Kubernetes**  
    - Set up a Jenkins pipeline to deploy applications to a Kubernetes cluster.  
    - Automate deployment using `kubectl` or `Helm`.

14. **Service Mesh with Istio or Linkerd**  
    - Deploy a service mesh for microservices.  
    - Implement traffic management, observability, and security.

15. **Dynamic Provisioning with CSI Drivers**  
    - Use a cloud providerâ€™s CSI driver (e.g., AWS EBS, Azure Disk) for dynamic volume provisioning.  
    - Automate storage class creation and usage.

16. **Kubernetes RBAC Configuration**  
    - Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to limit user permissions.  
    - Create roles, role bindings, and service accounts.

17. **Kubernetes on Bare Metal**  
    - Deploy a Kubernetes cluster on bare-metal servers using tools like Kubeadm or Kubespray.  
    - Configure networking with Calico or Flannel.

18. **Canary Deployment with Argo Rollouts**  
    - Set up Argo Rollouts to perform canary deployments.  
    - Monitor the rollout with metrics and automate rollback on failure.

19. **Backup and Restore**  
    - Use tools like Velero to back up and restore Kubernetes resources and persistent data.  
    - Simulate disaster recovery scenarios.

20. **Custom Helm Chart Development**  
    - Create and package a custom Helm chart for an application.  
    - Host the chart in a private or public Helm repository.

---

### **Expert Level**
21. **Multi-Cluster Kubernetes Management**  
    - Use tools like Rancher, KubeSphere, or ACM (Advanced Cluster Management) to manage multiple clusters.  
    - Deploy workloads across clusters and handle failover scenarios.

22. **Custom Kubernetes Operator**  
    - Develop a custom Kubernetes operator using the Operator SDK.  
    - Automate the management of a stateful application.

23. **Serverless with Kubernetes (Knative)**  
    - Deploy Knative to enable serverless workloads.  
    - Implement auto-scaling based on event triggers.

24. **Chaos Engineering**  
    - Use tools like Litmus Chaos or Chaos Mesh to simulate failures in the cluster.  
    - Test the resiliency of applications and infrastructure.

25. **Federated Clusters**  
    - Set up Kubernetes Federation to manage workloads across multiple clusters.  
    - Automate synchronization of resources.

26. **Advanced Networking with Cilium or Calico**  
    - Implement advanced network policies and observability using Cilium or Calico.  
    - Secure pod-to-pod communication and external traffic.

27. **AI/ML Workload Deployment**  
    - Use Kubernetes to deploy machine learning workflows with Kubeflow.  
    - Automate training, validation, and deployment of models.

28. **Custom Admission Controller**  
    - Develop a custom admission controller webhook to enforce policies on Kubernetes resources.  
    - Integrate it into the cluster.

29. **Monitoring with OpenTelemetry**  
    - Deploy and configure OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing and metrics collection.  
    - Analyze end-to-end application performance.

30. **Kubernetes Security with Falco or Aqua**  
    - Deploy Falco or Aqua Security to monitor and secure Kubernetes workloads.  
    - Automate vulnerability scanning and runtime threat detection.
