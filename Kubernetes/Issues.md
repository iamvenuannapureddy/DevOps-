<h1>Kubernetes issues</h1>

### 1. **Pods Stuck in "Pending" State**
   - **Cause**: This typically happens when there are insufficient resources or the node cannot schedule the pod.
   - **Solution**:
     - Check the reason for pending status:
       ```bash
       kubectl describe pod <pod_name>
       ```
     - Ensure enough resources (CPU, memory) are available on the nodes.
     - Check for node taints that might prevent pod scheduling:
       ```bash
       kubectl describe node <node_name>
       ```

### 2. **Pods Stuck in "CrashLoopBackOff"**
   - **Cause**: The container in the pod is repeatedly crashing.
   - **Solution**:
     - Check the pod’s logs to understand why the container is failing:
       ```bash
       kubectl logs <pod_name> -c <container_name>
       ```
     - Check if the container's entry point is correct and whether required configuration files or environment variables are missing.
     - Run the container in a local Docker environment to debug further.

### 3. **Kubernetes Node Not Ready**
   - **Cause**: Nodes may show as "NotReady" due to networking issues, insufficient resources, or node crashes.
   - **Solution**:
     - View node details:
       ```bash
       kubectl describe node <node_name>
       ```
     - Ensure the `kubelet` is running on the node:
       ```bash
       systemctl status kubelet
       ```
     - Check if there are networking issues by ensuring that the node can communicate with the control plane.

### 4. **Pods Stuck in "ImagePullBackOff" or "ErrImagePull"**
   - **Cause**: The pod cannot pull the specified image.
   - **Solution**:
     - Check if the image name and tag are correct.
     - Ensure that the image is publicly available or that Kubernetes has the correct credentials to pull from private registries.
     - Use `kubectl describe pod <pod_name>` to view detailed error messages.

### 5. **Persistent Volume (PV) Not Bound to Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)**
   - **Cause**: The storage class may not match, or there may be a resource misconfiguration.
   - **Solution**:
     - Describe the PVC to check for binding errors:
       ```bash
       kubectl describe pvc <pvc_name>
       ```
     - Ensure that the storage class in the PVC matches the PV.
     - Ensure that the requested storage in the PVC does not exceed the available capacity in the PV.

### 6. **Services Not Accessible (No External IP)**
   - **Cause**: The service of type `LoadBalancer` or `NodePort` is not getting an external IP.
   - **Solution**:
     - Check the service configuration using:
       ```bash
       kubectl describe svc <service_name>
       ```
     - Ensure the cloud provider's load balancer service is properly configured.
     - For `NodePort`, ensure that the port is open on the node and firewall settings allow external traffic.

### 7. **DNS Issues in Kubernetes (Pods Can't Resolve Hostnames)**
   - **Cause**: DNS pods may not be running, or there may be a configuration issue with `kube-dns` or `CoreDNS`.
   - **Solution**:
     - Ensure the DNS service is running:
       ```bash
       kubectl get pods -n kube-system
       ```
     - Check the `CoreDNS` logs for errors:
       ```bash
       kubectl logs -n kube-system <coredns_pod_name>
       ```
     - If DNS is misconfigured, verify the CoreDNS configuration by editing the ConfigMap:
       ```bash
       kubectl edit configmap coredns -n kube-system
       ```

### 8. **Error: "Unauthorized" When Accessing API Server**
   - **Cause**: Authentication or RBAC misconfigurations.
   - **Solution**:
     - Check the credentials being used to access the API server.
     - Verify the user has the correct role and permissions by checking the RoleBinding or ClusterRoleBinding:
       ```bash
       kubectl describe clusterrolebinding <binding_name>
       ```

### 9. **High API Server Latency**
   - **Cause**: The API server is overloaded or experiencing network issues.
   - **Solution**:
     - Check API server logs for any performance bottlenecks.
     - Ensure that the `etcd` cluster is healthy:
       ```bash
       kubectl get componentstatuses
       ```
     - If the issue is due to heavy workloads, consider horizontally scaling the control plane components or improving resource allocation.

### 10. **Pods Unable to Communicate With Each Other (Network Issues)**
   - **Cause**: Network policies, CNI plugin misconfigurations, or firewall issues.
   - **Solution**:
     - Check the pod’s network settings and the CNI plugin logs (Flannel, Calico, etc.).
     - Review network policies applied to the affected pods to ensure communication is allowed.
     - Verify the correct configuration of the cluster’s CNI plugin by inspecting its pods in the `kube-system` namespace.

### 11. **Kubectl Command Hangs or Is Slow**
   - **Cause**: High API server load or network issues between the control plane and the worker nodes.
   - **Solution**:
     - Check API server health and latency with:
       ```bash
       kubectl get --raw '/readyz'
       ```
     - Check for network delays or high resource usage in the control plane nodes.
     - Consider optimizing API server settings like request limits or enabling audit logging to detect high usage patterns.

### 12. **Pods Are Evicted Due to Resource Constraints**
   - **Cause**: The node does not have enough CPU, memory, or disk space, causing the pod to be evicted.
   - **Solution**:
     - Check the events to identify the reason for eviction:
       ```bash
       kubectl describe pod <pod_name>
       ```
     - Increase resource limits on the node, or add more nodes to the cluster.
     - Ensure that pods are properly requesting and limiting resources (using `requests` and `limits`):
       ```yaml
       resources:
         requests:
           memory: "128Mi"
           cpu: "500m"
         limits:
           memory: "256Mi"
           cpu: "1"
       ```

### 13. **Failed to Attach Volume to Pod**
   - **Cause**: Volume may not be available or there may be issues with the cloud provider’s storage integration.
   - **Solution**:
     - Check the events for the pod and the volume using:
       ```bash
       kubectl describe pod <pod_name>
       ```
     - Ensure the volume exists and is in a healthy state.
     - If using a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, GCP), check that the volume is available in the correct availability zone.

### 14. **HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler) Not Scaling**
   - **Cause**: Metrics server may not be running, or incorrect HPA configuration.
   - **Solution**:
     - Ensure the metrics server is deployed:
       ```bash
       kubectl get apiservices | grep metrics
       ```
     - Check if the HPA has proper CPU/memory targets configured and that the current resource usage crosses the threshold for scaling.
     - Use `kubectl describe hpa` to check for scaling events or issues.

### 15. **Kubernetes Certificate Expiry Issues**
   - **Cause**: Certificates for the API server, controller manager, or other components may have expired.
   - **Solution**:
     - Check the expiration of the Kubernetes certificates:
       ```bash
       kubeadm certs check-expiration
       ```
     - If expired, regenerate the certificates using kubeadm or the appropriate method, depending on how the cluster was set up.
