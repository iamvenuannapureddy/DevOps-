<h1>AWS services for a DevOps Engineer</h1>

---

### **Must-Know AWS Services**
These are critical for DevOps roles:

#### **1. Compute**
- **EC2**: To provision and manage virtual servers.
- **Lambda**: For serverless computing to run code without provisioning servers.
- **ECS/EKS**: For container orchestration (EKS for Kubernetes, ECS for Docker containers).
- **Elastic Beanstalk**: For deploying applications quickly with minimal setup.

#### **2. Storage**
- **S3**: For storing and retrieving objects, widely used for CI/CD artifacts.
- **EBS**: For persistent storage volumes for EC2 instances.
- **EFS**: Managed NFS for scalable file storage.

#### **3. Networking**
- **VPC**: Essential for setting up a secure, isolated network for your resources.
- **Route 53**: For domain registration and DNS routing.
- **Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)**: To distribute incoming traffic across multiple resources.
- **CloudFront**: Content Delivery Network (CDN) for caching and global delivery.

#### **4. CI/CD**
- **CodePipeline**: To automate the build, test, and deploy process.
- **CodeBuild**: For building and testing code.
- **CodeDeploy**: For automated deployment to various environments (e.g., EC2, Lambda, ECS).
- **CodeCommit**: A source control service similar to Git.

#### **5. Monitoring & Logging**
- **CloudWatch**: For monitoring logs, metrics, and alarms.
- **CloudTrail**: For logging API calls and tracking changes in your AWS environment.
- **AWS Config**: For compliance auditing and monitoring resource configurations.

#### **6. Security**
- **IAM**: For managing user access, roles, and policies.
- **Secrets Manager**: For securely storing credentials and API keys.
- **AWS Key Management Service (KMS)**: For encryption key management.

#### **7. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
- **CloudFormation**: For deploying and managing AWS infrastructure using templates.
- **AWS CDK**: For defining cloud infrastructure in popular programming languages.

### **Should-Know AWS Services**
These add more value and demonstrate expertise:

#### **1. DevOps & Developer Tools**
- **AWS X-Ray**: For debugging and analyzing application traces.
- **AWS CodeStar**: For quick setup of development projects in AWS.

#### **2. Databases**
- **RDS**: Managed relational databases.
- **DynamoDB**: Managed NoSQL database.
- **ElastiCache**: For in-memory caching (Redis/Memcached).
- **Aurora**: High-performance relational database engine.

#### **3. Container & Serverless Enhancements**
- **App Runner**: For deploying containerized web apps without managing infrastructure.
- **Fargate**: Serverless compute for ECS and EKS.

#### **4. Cost Management**
- **AWS Budgets**: To set up alerts for cost thresholds.
- **AWS Cost Explorer**: For analyzing and managing AWS spending.

#### **5. Advanced Networking**
- **Direct Connect**: For dedicated, low-latency connections.
- **Transit Gateway**: For interconnecting VPCs and on-premises networks.

#### **6. Machine Learning (Optional)**
- **SageMaker**: For deploying machine learning models (if your role overlaps with AI/ML pipelines).
