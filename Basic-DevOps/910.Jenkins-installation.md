Installing Jenkins on an EC2 instance with Ubuntu 24.04 involves several steps. Here's a comprehensive guide:

---

### **1. Launch an EC2 Instance**
1. Go to the **AWS Management Console** → **EC2** → **Instances** → **Launch Instance**.
2. Select **Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS (HVM)** as the AMI.
3. Choose an instance type (e.g., `t2.micro` for testing).
4. Configure the **Security Group**:
   - Add rules to allow:
     - **SSH** (port `22`) for connecting to the instance.
     - **Jenkins** (port `8080`).
     - **HTTP** (port `80`) if needed.

---

### **2. Connect to the EC2 Instance**
Connect via SSH to the instance using its **Public IP**:

```bash
ssh -i <your-key.pem> ubuntu@<Public-IP>
```

---

### **3. Update the System**
Run the following commands to ensure the system is up to date:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
```

---

### **4. Install Java**
Jenkins requires Java. Install OpenJDK:

```bash
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk -y
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
java -version
```

---

### **5. Add Jenkins Repository**
Add the Jenkins package repository and its GPG key:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io.key | sudo tee \
  /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null

echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
```

---

### **6. Install Jenkins**
Update the package list and install Jenkins:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install jenkins -y
```

---

### **7. Start and Enable Jenkins**
Start the Jenkins service and enable it to start on boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl start jenkins
sudo systemctl enable jenkins
```

Verify Jenkins is running:

```bash
sudo systemctl status jenkins
```

---

### **8. Open Firewall for Jenkins**
If **UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)** is enabled, allow traffic on Jenkins' port (`8080`):

```bash
sudo ufw allow 8080
sudo ufw allow OpenSSH
sudo ufw enable
```

---

### **9. Access Jenkins**
1. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://<EC2-Instance-Public-IP>:8080
   ```
2. Retrieve the initial admin password from the server:

   ```bash
   sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
   ```

3. Paste the password into the Jenkins web interface to unlock Jenkins.

---

### **10. Complete Jenkins Setup**
1. Install recommended plugins when prompted.
2. Create an admin user.
3. Configure Jenkins as per your requirements.

---

### **Optional Steps**
1. **Attach an Elastic IP** to your instance for a static IP.
2. **Secure Jenkins with HTTPS**:
   - Set up a reverse proxy (e.g., using Nginx or Apache).
   - Obtain an SSL certificate (e.g., using Let's Encrypt).
3. **Integrate with GitHub or CI/CD pipelines**.

---

This process ensures Jenkins is installed and accessible on Ubuntu 24.04 running on an EC2 instance. Let me know if you encounter any issues!

<h1>Issues</h1>
The error occurs because the GPG key for the Jenkins repository is missing or not properly added. This can happen if the repository's signing key has changed or if the commands to add the key were incomplete. Here's how to resolve the issue:

---

### **Fix: Add Jenkins Repository with the Correct Key**

1. **Remove Existing Jenkins Repository (if added incorrectly):**

   ```bash
   sudo rm -f /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list
   sudo rm -f /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc
   ```

2. **Add the Jenkins Key and Repository Again:**

   Update the method to add the GPG key using the `wget` command, which is more reliable for some environments:

   ```bash
   wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key | sudo tee \
   /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null
   ```

   Then, add the repository:

   ```bash
   echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
   https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \
   /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
   ```

3. **Update Package List and Install Jenkins:**

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install jenkins -y
   ```

---

### **Explanation**
- **NO_PUBKEY Error**: The key `5BA31D57EF5975CA` wasn't available to verify the repository. Adding the correct key resolves this.
- **Repository Not Signed**: Adding the repository with the proper GPG key ensures secure installation.

---

### **Verify Jenkins Installation**
After completing the steps, check the Jenkins service status:

```bash
sudo systemctl status jenkins
```

Then access Jenkins via `http://<Public-IP>:8080`.
