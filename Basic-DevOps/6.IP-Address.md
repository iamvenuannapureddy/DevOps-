<h1>IP Address Overview</h1>

An **IP address** (Internet Protocol address) is a unique identifier assigned to each device connected to a network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. There are two versions of IP addresses in use:

#### 1. **IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4)**
   - Consists of four 8-bit numbers, separated by dots, each ranging from 0 to 255. For example, `192.168.1.1`.
   - The total number of IPv4 addresses is about 4.3 billion (2^32).
   - It is the most widely used IP addressing system but is running out of available addresses.

#### 2. **IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6)**
   - Introduced to solve the depletion of IPv4 addresses.
   - It uses 128-bit addresses, written as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits. For example, `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`.
   - Provides a much larger address space (about 340 undecillion addresses, 2^128).

#### Types of IP Addresses:
   1. **Public IP Addresses**: These are unique across the internet and are used for devices that need to communicate externally (e.g., websites, servers).
   2. **Private IP Addresses**: Used within local networks (LAN). They are not routable over the internet. Common private IP ranges include:
      - `192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255`
      - `172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255`
      - `10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255`

#### IP Address Classes (IPv4):
   1. **Class A**: `1.0.0.0 – 126.255.255.255` (used by very large networks).
   2. **Class B**: `128.0.0.0 – 191.255.255.255` (used by medium-sized networks).
   3. **Class C**: `192.0.0.0 – 223.255.255.255` (used by small networks).
   4. **Class D**: `224.0.0.0 – 239.255.255.255` (reserved for multicast groups).
   5. **Class E**: `240.0.0.0 – 255.255.255.255` (reserved for experimental purposes).

### Ports Overview

**Ports** are logical channels that allow networked devices to communicate with each other. They are used to distinguish different types of traffic coming from the same IP address. Each port is associated with a specific protocol or service.

- A port number is a 16-bit integer, ranging from `0` to `65535`.
- Ports are divided into three categories:
  1. **Well-Known Ports (0–1023)**: Reserved for common services and protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP).
  2. **Registered Ports (1024–49151)**: Used by user processes or applications.
  3. **Dynamic/Private Ports (49152–65535)**: Temporary ports often assigned by the system for short-lived connections.

#### Common Ports and Protocols:
   - **HTTP (Port 80)**: Used for web traffic (insecure).
   - **HTTPS (Port 443)**: Used for secure web traffic.
   - **FTP (Port 21)**: Used for file transfers.
   - **SSH (Port 22)**: Used for secure shell access.
   - **DNS (Port 53)**: Used for domain name resolution.
   - **SMTP (Port 25)**: Used for email transmission.

### Protocols Overview

**Protocols** define the rules for data exchange over the internet or other networks. Each protocol operates at different layers of the **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection)** model or the **TCP/IP model**.

#### Key Protocols:
1. **IP (Internet Protocol)**:
   - Operates at Layer 3 (Network Layer) of the OSI model.
   - Responsible for addressing, routing, and delivering packets of data from one device to another.

2. **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**:
   - Operates at Layer 4 (Transport Layer) of the OSI model.
   - Connection-oriented protocol ensuring reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data.
   - Commonly used by applications that require data integrity (e.g., HTTP, FTP).

3. **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**:
   - Also operates at Layer 4 (Transport Layer).
   - Connectionless, faster, but less reliable than TCP.
   - Commonly used for real-time applications like video streaming and online gaming (e.g., DNS, VoIP).

4. **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**:
   - Operates at Layer 7 (Application Layer).
   - Used for transmitting web pages over the internet.

5. **HTTPS (HTTP Secure)**:
   - A secure version of HTTP that uses **TLS/SSL** to encrypt data between the web server and browser.

6. **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**:
   - Operates at Layer 7.
   - Used for transferring files between a client and a server.

7. **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)**:
   - Also operates at Layer 7.
   - Used for sending and receiving email.

8. **DNS (Domain Name System)**:
   - Resolves domain names (e.g., `example.com`) into IP addresses.
   - Uses both UDP and TCP on port 53.

### How IP Addresses, Ports, and Protocols Work Together

When a device communicates over the internet:
1. It is assigned an IP address that identifies it on the network.
2. The communication happens over a specific **port**. For example, a web server listens on port 80 for HTTP traffic or 443 for HTTPS traffic.
3. The traffic follows rules defined by the **protocol**. For example, an email might be sent using SMTP, while a web page is delivered using HTTP or HTTPS.

For instance, when you visit a website:
- Your browser communicates with the web server over **port 443** (HTTPS) using the **TCP/IP protocol**.
- Your request for `https://example.com` is converted into an IP address by the **DNS protocol**.
- The data exchange follows the rules defined by the **HTTP/HTTPS protocol**.
