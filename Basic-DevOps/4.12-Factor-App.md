<h1>12-Factor App</h1>

The **12-Factor App** is a methodology for building modern, scalable, and maintainable cloud-native applications. It was developed by Heroku to provide a set of best practices and guidelines for designing software that can effectively run in a distributed, dynamic environment like the cloud. The methodology applies primarily to web applications but can also be used for any app designed to be deployed and managed in a scalable environment.

Here’s an overview of the **12 Factors**:

---

### 1. **Codebase**
- **One codebase tracked in version control, many deploys.**
- A 12-factor app has a **single codebase** that is stored in a version control system (such as Git) and is shared across all environments (development, staging, production).
- Each instance of the app (e.g., development, production) is a deployment of that same codebase. Branches, tags, and forks allow for multiple environments, but the base code is unified.

---

### 2. **Dependencies**
- **Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies.**
- Dependencies (libraries, packages, etc.) should be **explicitly declared** in a manifest file (e.g., `requirements.txt` for Python or `package.json` for Node.js).
- Use a dependency manager (like pip, npm, or Maven) to install dependencies. **No implicit dependencies** should be relied upon.
- Ensure the app's dependencies are **isolated** from the system environment by using tools like virtual environments or containers (e.g., Docker).

---

### 3. **Config**
- **Store configuration in the environment.**
- Configuration includes anything that varies between deployments (e.g., credentials, API keys, database URIs).
- All configuration should be stored in **environment variables**, not hardcoded in the application code. This ensures that the codebase remains the same across environments, with differences managed through configuration.

---

### 4. **Backing Services**
- **Treat backing services as attached resources.**
- Backing services (like databases, message queues, caching systems, and third-party APIs) should be treated as **external resources** that are attached to the application via configuration.
- Switching between local and remote services (e.g., switching from a local MySQL instance to a cloud-based one) should be as simple as changing a configuration setting.

---

### 5. **Build, Release, Run**
- **Strictly separate build and run stages.**
- The lifecycle of a 12-factor app has three distinct stages:
  1. **Build stage**: The app is built from the codebase, including compiling code and fetching dependencies.
  2. **Release stage**: The build is combined with the current config to produce a release.
  3. **Run stage**: The release is executed in the runtime environment.
- Releases should be **immutable**; once a release is made, it should not be changed. If there is an issue, a new release should be created.

---

### 6. **Processes**
- **Execute the app as one or more stateless processes.**
- A 12-factor app runs in a **stateless** process. Any data that needs to persist should be stored in a backing service like a database or cache (e.g., Redis).
- Processes should be **disposable**, meaning they can be started or stopped at any time without losing data.
- The state should never be stored in memory or on the filesystem. Instead, it should be offloaded to an external resource.

---

### 7. **Port Binding**
- **Export services via port binding.**
- A 12-factor app does not rely on an external web server (like Apache or Nginx) to serve the application. Instead, the app itself **binds to a port** and listens for incoming HTTP requests.
- This is typical for web applications written in languages like Node.js or Go, where the app serves its own web server via port binding.

---

### 8. **Concurrency**
- **Scale out via the process model.**
- Instead of scaling vertically (adding more CPU or memory to a single machine), a 12-factor app should be designed to **scale horizontally** by running multiple processes.
- Different processes may handle different parts of the workload (e.g., web requests, background jobs), allowing for flexible scaling.

---

### 9. **Disposability**
- **Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown.**
- Processes should be **disposable**—they should start quickly and shut down gracefully. This enables rapid scaling, deployment, and recovery.
- A 12-factor app should handle unexpected terminations gracefully and clean up any resources (like open connections) during shutdown.

---

### 10. **Dev/Prod Parity**
- **Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible.**
- Minimize the differences between development and production environments. Development and production should be kept in **close parity**, including the following:
  - Time: code should be deployed as frequently as possible.
  - Personnel: developers should be involved in deployment and operation.
  - Tools: use the same backing services and technology in all environments.
- This reduces the risk of bugs and issues that only appear in production due to environment differences.

---

### 11. **Logs**
- **Treat logs as event streams.**
- A 12-factor app should not worry about managing log files. Instead, **logs should be treated as event streams**.
- The app should write logs to `stdout` and allow the execution environment to capture and aggregate them.
- This decouples log management from the app, allowing for flexibility in how logs are stored and analyzed (e.g., via tools like Splunk or ELK stack).

---

### 12. **Admin Processes**
- **Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes.**
- Any administrative or maintenance tasks (such as database migrations or running one-off scripts) should be run as **one-off processes** in the same environment as the app’s normal processes.
- Admin tasks should be invoked in the same way as other application processes, ensuring they are consistent with the app’s runtime environment.

---

### Summary of Benefits

By following the **12-factor** principles, developers can create applications that are:
- **Portable** across different cloud platforms.
- **Scalable** to handle varying loads.
- **Maintainable** with clean separation of concerns and clear deployment pipelines.
- **Resilient** to failures with stateless and disposable processes.

The 12-Factor methodology is highly recommended for **cloud-native applications**, making them easier to deploy, manage, and scale across modern cloud infrastructure like AWS, Google Cloud, or Heroku.
