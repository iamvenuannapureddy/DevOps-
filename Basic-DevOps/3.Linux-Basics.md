<h1>Linux Basics and Commands Overview</h1>

Linux is a powerful, open-source operating system widely used in servers, development environments, and as the backbone of many technologies. It provides a command-line interface (CLI) for users to interact with the system, manipulate files, manage processes, and perform administrative tasks. Below is an overview of the basics of Linux, along with essential Linux commands categorized for easy reference.

### 1. **Basic Linux Concepts**

- **Kernel**: The core part of Linux that manages hardware and system resources.
- **Shell**: A command-line interpreter (e.g., Bash, Zsh) that allows users to interact with the operating system.
- **Terminal**: The program that provides the command-line interface (CLI) where commands are entered.
- **File System**: Linux follows a hierarchical directory structure with `/` (root) being the top-level directory. Everything in Linux is treated as a file, including hardware and devices.

  ls
  ls -l   # Detailed list with permissions, owner, size, etc.
  ls -a   # List all files, including hidden files
  ```

  cd /path/to/directory
  cd ~   # Navigate to home directory
  cd ..  # Go up one level in the directory tree
  ```

  ```bash
  touch new_file.txt
  ```

- **`cat`**: Display the contents of a file.
  ```bash
  cat file.txt
  ```

- **`less`**: View a file one page at a time.
  ```bash
  less file.txt
  ```

  ```bash
  head file.txt     # View the first 10 lines
  tail file.txt     # View the last 10 lines
  tail -f file.txt  # View live updates to a file (like logs)
  ```

### 3. **File Permissions and Ownership Commands**

Linux files and directories have associated permissions (read, write, execute) for the owner, group, and others.

- **`chmod`**: Change file or directory permissions.
  ```bash
  chmod 755 file_name  # Owner can read/write/execute; others can read/execute
  chmod +x script.sh   # Add execute permission to a script
  ```

- **`chown`**: Change file ownership (user and group).
  ```bash
  chown user:group file_name
  ```

- **`chgrp`**: Change the group ownership of a file or directory.
  ```bash
  chgrp group_name file_name
  ```

- **`ls -l`**: Displays the file permissions.
  ```bash
  -rw-r--r--  1 user group  1234 Sep 14 12:34 file_name
  ```

### 4. **System Information Commands**

These commands allow you to gather system-related information, including disk usage, memory, and processes.

- **`uname`**: Displays system information.
  ```bash
  uname -a   # Display all system information
  uname -r   # Display kernel version
  ```

- **`df`**: Display file system disk space usage.
  ```bash
  df -h   # Display disk space in human-readable format
  ```

- **`du`**: Display the disk usage of files and directories.
  ```bash
  du -sh   # Display the total size of the current directory
  du -h file_name  # Show the size of a specific file or directory
  ```

- **`free`**: Display memory usage (RAM and swap).
  ```bash
  free -h   # Display memory usage in human-readable format
  ```

- **`top`**: Display real-time information about running processes.
  ```bash
  top
  ```

- **`ps`**: Display information about running processes.
  ```bash
  ps aux  # Detailed process list with user, CPU, and memory usage
  ```

- **`kill`**: Kill a running process.
  ```bash
  kill process_id
  kill -9 process_id  # Forcefully kill a process
  ```

### 5. **File Searching and Text Processing Commands**

These commands help in searching for files or patterns within files, and manipulating text.

- **`find`**: Search for files and directories.
  ```bash
  find /path -name "file_name"  # Find files by name
  ```

- **`grep`**: Search for patterns within files.
  ```bash
  grep "pattern" file.txt  # Search for a pattern in a file
  grep -r "pattern" /path/to/directory  # Search recursively
  ```

- **`sed`**: Stream editor for searching and replacing text.
  ```bash
  sed 's/old_text/new_text/g' file.txt  # Replace old_text with new_text
  ```

- **`awk`**: Text processing language for extracting and manipulating data from files.
  ```bash
  awk '{print $1}' file.txt  # Print the first column of a file
  ```
