<h1>Servers</h1>

Here's an overview of **Web Servers**, **Database Servers**, and **Application Servers**:

### 1. **Web Servers**  
**Purpose**:  
A web server handles HTTP requests from clients (usually browsers) and serves static content like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and other media. It also forwards dynamic requests to other servers (like application servers).  

**Key Features**:
- Handles HTTP/HTTPS requests.
- Manages static files and content.
- May have some ability to handle basic server-side scripting (like PHP).

**Popular Web Servers**:
- **Apache HTTP Server**: Open-source, widely used, and highly configurable.
- **NGINX**: Lightweight, known for performance and efficient handling of multiple connections.
- **Microsoft IIS**: Web server designed for Windows servers.

**Use Case**:  
Typical use case is serving static web content directly to users, acting as a reverse proxy, or load balancing between backend servers.

### 2. **Database Servers**  
**Purpose**:  
A database server stores, manages, and provides access to data in databases. It supports CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and allows multiple clients to access structured or semi-structured data.

**Key Features**:
- Manages data storage and retrieval.
- Handles database queries and transactions.
- Supports database security, indexing, and backup functionalities.

**Popular Database Servers**:
- **MySQL**: Open-source relational database management system (RDBMS).
- **PostgreSQL**: Open-source RDBMS with advanced features like extensibility.
- **Microsoft SQL Server**: Relational database by Microsoft with high availability and security features.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database, stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents.
  
**Use Case**:  
Database servers are used in backend systems to manage large datasets and efficiently serve data requests, usually for applications requiring structured (relational) or unstructured (NoSQL) data.

### 3. **Application Servers**  
**Purpose**:  
An application server handles the business logic of an application. It processes dynamic content and interacts with databases or other services to execute complex transactions and computations. It often works in conjunction with a web server to serve dynamic requests.

**Key Features**:
- Executes server-side logic and processes requests.
- Manages backend services such as transaction handling, message queues, etc.
- May support APIs, web services, or microservices.

**Popular Application Servers**:
- **Apache Tomcat**: Open-source, typically used for Java-based web applications.
- **JBoss (WildFly)**: Java-based application server supporting Enterprise Java Beans (EJB).
- **WebLogic**: Java EE application server by Oracle, used in enterprise applications.
- **Node.js**: Server-side JavaScript runtime environment for building fast, scalable web applications.

**Use Case**:  
Application servers are key in dynamic websites or web applications, executing server-side code, processing API calls, interacting with databases, and providing core functionality of the app.

### **How They Work Together**  
- **Web Server**: Receives a request for a web page (e.g., `www.example.com`) and forwards the request to an application server for dynamic processing.
- **Application Server**: Processes the dynamic content (e.g., retrieving user info from a database or calculating the result of a business transaction).
- **Database Server**: Stores the actual data that the application server requests or manipulates.

For example, when a user logs into an e-commerce website:
1. The **web server** handles the incoming HTTP request.
2. The **application server** processes the login form and checks the credentials.
3. The **database server** verifies user credentials and returns results to the application server.
4. The **web server** serves the response (e.g., the user dashboard) back to the client.
