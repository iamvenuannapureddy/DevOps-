The `chmod` command in Linux/Unix is used to **change file permissions**. File permissions control who can read, write, or execute a file or directory. Here's a comprehensive overview:

### **1. File Permissions**
Linux files have three types of permissions:
- **Read (`r`)**: Ability to read the file's contents.
- **Write (`w`)**: Ability to modify the file's contents.
- **Execute (`x`)**: Ability to execute the file as a program or script.

Each file has these permissions assigned to three categories:
- **Owner (User)**: The user who owns the file.
- **Group**: A group of users that the file belongs to.
- **Others (World)**: All other users.

Permissions are represented in the format:  
**`rwxrwxrwx`**  
- First set: Permissions for the **owner**.
- Second set: Permissions for the **group**.
- Third set: Permissions for **others**.

Example:  
`-rw-r--r--`  
- **`-`**: Indicates it’s a file (or `d` for a directory).
- **`rw-`**: Owner has read and write permissions.
- **`r--`**: Group has read permission only.
- **`r--`**: Others have read permission only.

### **2. Changing Permissions with `chmod`**

#### a) **Symbolic Mode**
Uses letters to modify permissions for specific categories:
- **u**: User/Owner
- **g**: Group
- **o**: Others
- **a**: All (u, g, and o)

Modifiers:
- **`+`**: Add permission.
- **`-`**: Remove permission.
- **`=`**: Set permission explicitly.

Examples:
- `chmod u+x file`: Adds execute permission for the owner.
- `chmod g-w file`: Removes write permission for the group.
- `chmod o=r file`: Sets others’ permission to read only.
- `chmod a+r file`: Adds read permission for everyone.

#### b) **Numeric Mode (Octal)**
Permissions are represented as octal numbers:
- **4**: Read
- **2**: Write
- **1**: Execute
- **0**: No permission

Each permission set is a sum of these values:
- **`rwx` = 7** (4 + 2 + 1)
- **`rw-` = 6** (4 + 2)
- **`r--` = 4** (4)

Syntax: `chmod [permissions] file`
- **Example**: `chmod 755 file`
  - **7 (rwx)**: Owner has read, write, and execute permissions.
  - **5 (r-x)**: Group has read and execute permissions.
  - **5 (r-x)**: Others have read and execute permissions.

### **3. Special Permissions**
#### a) **Set User ID (SUID)** (`s` in place of `x` for owner):
Allows a file to run with the permissions of its owner.  
Example: `chmod u+s file`

#### b) **Set Group ID (SGID)** (`s` in place of `x` for group):
Allows files created within a directory to inherit the group of the directory.  
Example: `chmod g+s dir`

#### c) **Sticky Bit** (`t` in place of `x` for others):
Restricts deletion of files in a shared directory to the owner of the file.  
Example: `chmod +t dir`

---

### **4. Examples**
- `chmod 644 file`: Owner can read/write; group and others can read.
- `chmod 700 file`: Owner has full permissions; group and others have none.
- `chmod u=rw,go=r file`: Symbolically sets owner permissions to read/write and group/others to read only.

---

### **5. Checking File Permissions**
Use the `ls -l` command:  
```bash
ls -l file
```
Example output:  
`-rwxr-xr-- 1 user group 1234 Dec 21 10:00 file`

### Summary Table for Numeric Permissions:
| **Numeric** | **Permission** | **Explanation**      |
|-------------|----------------|----------------------|
| 0           | `---`          | No permissions       |
| 1           | `--x`          | Execute only         |
| 2           | `-w-`          | Write only           |
| 3           | `-wx`          | Write and execute    |
| 4           | `r--`          | Read only            |
| 5           | `r-x`          | Read and execute     |
| 6           | `rw-`          | Read and write       |
| 7           | `rwx`          | Read, write, execute |
