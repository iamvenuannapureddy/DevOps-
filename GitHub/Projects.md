### **Beginner Level**
1. **Create a Personal Portfolio Repository**  
   - Set up a GitHub repository to showcase your portfolio.  
   - Use GitHub Pages to host a static website for free.

2. **Version Control Practice**  
   - Create a simple project (e.g., a to-do app) and use Git for version control.  
   - Practice commits, branching, and merging.

3. **Collaborative Markdown Documentation**  
   - Create a repository for collaborative documentation (e.g., a README template).  
   - Use issues and pull requests for contributions.

4. **GitHub Actions for Automation**  
   - Set up a simple GitHub Action to automatically run tests on push or pull requests.  

5. **Code Review Workflow**  
   - Simulate a team environment by creating branches, submitting pull requests, and reviewing code.  

6. **Issue Tracker**  
   - Use GitHub Issues to track and manage project tasks and bugs.  
   - Add labels and milestones to organize work.

### **Intermediate Level**
7. **Open Source Contribution**  
   - Find an open-source project on GitHub, fork it, and submit a pull request.  
   - Document your experience and contributions.

8. **Automated Documentation Deployment**  
   - Create a repository for code documentation (e.g., with Sphinx or JSDoc).  
   - Use GitHub Actions to deploy the docs to GitHub Pages.

9. **GitHub Wiki for Project Documentation**  
   - Add detailed project documentation to the GitHub Wiki.  
   - Organize the content with sections like setup, usage, and troubleshooting.

10. **Monorepo for Multiple Projects**  
    - Create a monorepo to manage multiple related projects (e.g., frontend and backend).  
    - Use a structured branching strategy for each project.

11. **Project Management with GitHub Projects**  
    - Use GitHub Projects to create a Kanban board for task management.  
    - Link issues and pull requests to the board.

12. **Code Coverage Reporting**  
    - Set up a GitHub Action to generate and display code coverage reports using tools like Coveralls or Codecov.

    - Include build, test, deploy, and post-deployment validation stages.

18. **GitHub Advanced Security Features**  
    - Enable and configure GitHub’s advanced security features like Dependabot alerts, secret scanning, and code scanning.  
    - Automate fixes for vulnerabilities.

19. **Infrastructure as Code Repository**  
    - Create a repository to manage infrastructure using tools like Terraform or CloudFormation.  
    - Use GitHub Actions to validate and apply changes.

20. **Multi-Repo Dependency Management**  
    - Manage dependencies across multiple repositories using Git submodules or monorepo strategies.  
    - Automate dependency updates with scripts or Actions.
