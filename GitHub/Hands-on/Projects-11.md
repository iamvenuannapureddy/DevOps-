### **Project: Project Management using GitHub Projects**

The goal of this project is to effectively manage tasks and issues using GitHub's built-in project management tools. This involves creating a project board to visualize the progress of issues and pull requests (PRs) in a Kanban-style format, allowing for better organization and tracking of development tasks.

### **1. Project Directory Structure**

This project assumes you have a GitHub repository to work with. Below is a basic directory structure for the project code:

```bash
project-management/
│
├── .github/                          # GitHub workflows (optional)
│   └── workflows/
│       └── ci.yml                    # GitHub Actions workflow (optional)
├── src/                              # Application source code
│   └── app.py                        # Example Python app
├── tests/                            # Directory for unit tests
│   └── test_app.py                   # Example test file
├── README.md                         # Project documentation
└── LICENSE                           # License file
```

### **2. Setting Up GitHub Project Board**

#### **2.1. Create a GitHub Project Board**

1. **Navigate to Your Repository**: Go to your GitHub repository.
2. **Go to Projects**: Click on the "Projects" tab.
3. **Create a New Project**: Click on "New Project" and choose "Project" (the new Projects experience).
4. **Configure Project Board**:
   - **Name**: Give your project a name (e.g., "Development Tasks").
   - **Description**: Optionally add a description of what this project will manage.
   - **Visibility**: Choose whether the project is public or private.

#### **2.2. Set Up Columns**

1. **Default Columns**: The project will have default columns such as "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done".
2. **Customize Columns**: You can add or remove columns based on your team's workflow:
   - Click on **Add column** to create a new column.
   - Rename existing columns by clicking on the column title.

### **3. Organizing Issues and Pull Requests**

#### **3.1. Creating Issues**

1. **Create Issues**: For each task or feature, create a GitHub issue:
   - Click on the "Issues" tab in your repository.
   - Click on "New Issue".
   - Add a title and description. Optionally, label the issue (e.g., bug, enhancement) to categorize it.
   - Assign the issue to a team member if needed.

#### **3.2. Linking Issues to the Project Board**

1. **Add Issues to Project**: While creating or editing an issue, link it to the project board:
   - Scroll down to the "Projects" section in the issue editor.
   - Select the project board you created and choose the column where you want to place the issue (e.g., "To Do").

#### **3.3. Creating Pull Requests**

1. **Create PRs**: When you are ready to merge your changes:
   - Go to the "Pull Requests" tab and click on "New Pull Request".
   - Create a PR from your feature branch to the main branch.
   - In the PR description, reference the related issue (e.g., "Fixes #1") to automatically link them.

#### **3.4. Automate Task Progress Updates**

1. **Automate Updates**: As PRs are created or closed, their status will automatically update in the project board. 
2. **Move Issues**: Drag and drop issues between columns based on their progress (e.g., from "To Do" to "In Progress" when work begins).

---

### **4. Example Project Management Workflow**

1. **Initiate Project**:
   - Set up the GitHub repository with the necessary directories and files (e.g., source code and tests).
   - Create issues for each feature, bug, or task.
   - Organize these issues into the project board.

2. **Development Process**:
   - Developers work on issues by creating feature branches.
   - Each time a developer completes an issue, they create a pull request, linking the issue for easy tracking.
   - Move the issue from "To Do" to "In Progress" and finally to "Done" as work progresses.

3. **Code Review**:
   - Team members review pull requests and provide feedback.
   - Once approved, merge the PR, which automatically links the completed work to the project board.

4. **Completion**:
   - Regularly update the project board to reflect the current status of tasks.
   - Use the project board to generate reports or meetings about project progress.

### **5. Optional: Automating with GitHub Actions**

You can further enhance your project management by integrating **GitHub Actions** to automate certain processes, such as sending notifications when an issue is updated or automatically closing related issues when a PR is merged.

#### **Example Workflow (.github/workflows/project-management.yml)**

```yaml
name: Project Management Automation

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [closed]

jobs:
  update-project-board:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check out the code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Update Project Board
        run: |
          echo "Automated process to update project board here."
          # You can use GitHub API calls to automate further updates based on PR/issue states.
```
