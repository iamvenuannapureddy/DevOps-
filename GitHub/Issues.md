<h1>GitHub Issues</h1>

### 1. **Permission Denied (Publickey)**
   - **Cause**: You do not have the correct SSH key configured or added to your GitHub account.
   - **Solution**:
     - Ensure that you have generated an SSH key using `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096`.
     - Add the public key to your GitHub account by going to **Settings > SSH and GPG Keys**.
     - Test your connection with `ssh -T git@github.com`.

### 2. **Repository Not Found**
   - **Cause**: The URL of the repository is incorrect, or you don’t have access to the repository.
   - **Solution**:
     - Double-check the repository URL (`git remote -v`).
     - Ensure that you have the correct permissions to access the repository.
     - If it's a private repository, verify that you've been added as a collaborator or have the correct authentication.

### 3. **Large File Size Limit Exceeded**
   - **Cause**: GitHub imposes a file size limit (typically 100MB for individual files).
   - **Solution**:
     - Use [Git LFS (Large File Storage)](https://git-lfs.github.com/) for versioning large files.
     - Remove large files from history using `git filter-branch` or `BFG Repo-Cleaner`.
     - Alternatively, break down the large file into smaller chunks, if feasible.

### 4. **Merge Conflict in Pull Request**
   - **Cause**: Conflicts between your branch and the target branch of the repository.
   - **Solution**:
     - Rebase or merge the latest changes from the target branch into your branch to resolve conflicts locally.
     - After resolving the conflicts, push the changes back to your branch, which will update the pull request.

### 5. **Failed to Push to Protected Branch**
   - **Cause**: GitHub has branch protection rules that prevent direct pushes to certain branches (e.g., `main` or `master`).
   - **Solution**:
     - Follow the repository’s workflow (e.g., create a feature branch, make a pull request).
     - Collaborate with the repository maintainer to merge changes via pull requests.

### 6. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Issues**
   - **Cause**: You are required to use two-factor authentication (2FA), but it’s not set up correctly.
   - **Solution**:
     - Ensure that 2FA is enabled and properly configured on your GitHub account.
     - If using HTTPS to push changes, you’ll need a personal access token (PAT) instead of your GitHub password.
     - Generate a PAT by going to **Settings > Developer Settings > Personal Access Tokens** and use this in place of your password when pushing.

### 7. **GitHub Actions Failing**
   - **Cause**: There is an issue in your workflow configuration file (e.g., `.github/workflows/main.yml`).
   - **Solution**:
     - Check the GitHub Actions logs to identify where the workflow failed.
     - Ensure that the syntax in the workflow YAML file is correct.
     - Verify that all secrets and environment variables are configured properly for the workflow to function.

### 8. **Too Many Forks of a Repository**
   - **Cause**: GitHub restricts the number of forks you can create from a repository.
   - **Solution**:
     - Instead of forking, you can create a new clone by running:
       ```bash
       git clone --bare https://github.com/owner/repo.git
       ```
     - Then, push this bare clone to a new repository on GitHub.

### 9. **Push Rejected Due to Large Number of Files**
   - **Cause**: The repository contains too many files, and GitHub restricts large pushes for performance reasons.
   - **Solution**:
     - Try breaking the push into smaller batches of commits by limiting the number of files per commit.
     - Alternatively, consider excluding unnecessary files from the repository using a `.gitignore` file.

### 10. **Unresolved Pull Request Review Comments**
   - **Cause**: A pull request is blocked due to pending review comments.
   - **Solution**:
     - Address the reviewer’s comments by making changes in your pull request.
     - Mark the comments as resolved after addressing the issues.
     - Optionally request a re-review if necessary.

### 11. **Rate Limit Exceeded**
   - **Cause**: API requests (e.g., when working with GitHub APIs or integrations) have exceeded the allowed limit.
   - **Solution**:
     - Monitor API usage and reduce unnecessary requests.
     - If necessary, consider using authentication (OAuth tokens or personal access tokens) to increase the rate limit.

### 12. **GitHub Pages Deployment Issues**
   - **Cause**: GitHub Pages may not deploy properly due to configuration issues or invalid Jekyll setups.
   - **Solution**:
     - Ensure the `gh-pages` branch (or your designated branch) is correctly set up and has the required files.
     - Check for any build errors in the GitHub Pages settings under the repository’s **Settings > Pages**.
     - If using Jekyll, ensure your `_config.yml` and other site structure files are set up properly.

### 13. **Webhook Not Triggering**
   - **Cause**: The webhook is not correctly set up or the payload URL is incorrect.
   - **Solution**:
     - Verify that the webhook URL and secret are configured correctly in **Settings > Webhooks**.
     - Check for any delivery errors or logs in the webhook settings to identify the problem.
