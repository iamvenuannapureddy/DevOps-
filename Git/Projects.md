<h1>Projects on GIT</h1>

### 1. **Basic Git Repository Setup**
   - **Goal**: Learn the basics of Git for version control.
   - **Steps**:
     - Initialize a Git repository using `git init`.
     - Stage and commit files with `git add` and `git commit`.
     - Explore branching and merging using `git branch`, `git checkout`, and `git merge`.
     - Push your code to a remote repository (e.g., GitHub) using `git push`.

### 2. **Collaborative Open-Source Projects**
   - **Goal**: Contribute to an open-source project.
   - **Steps**:
     - Fork the repository on GitHub.
     - Clone the project locally using `git clone`.
     - Make changes in a new branch.
     - Commit and push your changes.
     - Create a Pull Request (PR) to suggest changes to the original repository.

### 3. **Feature Branch Workflow**
   - **Goal**: Work on individual features in isolation before integrating them.
   - **Steps**:
     - Create a feature branch using `git checkout -b feature/branch-name`.
     - Make your changes, then commit them.
     - When the feature is complete, merge it into the main branch using `git merge` or submit a PR if working with a team.

### 4. **Git with Continuous Integration (CI) Tools**
   - **Goal**: Set up Git to trigger automated tests on commit or pull requests.
   - **Steps**:
     - Set up a repository in GitHub.
     - Integrate CI tools like Jenkins, CircleCI, or GitHub Actions.
     - Define build/test steps in a pipeline (e.g., `.jenkinsfile` or `.github/workflows`).
     - Trigger automated builds and tests for every commit or PR.

### 5. **Git with Containerized Applications (Docker)**
   - **Goal**: Use Git to version control your containerized application.
   - **Steps**:
     - Create a repository for your Dockerfile and application code.
     - Version control the Docker configuration files using Git.
     - Automate building and pushing Docker images to Docker Hub using Git hooks or CI/CD tools.

### 6. **GitOps with Kubernetes**
   - **Goal**: Deploy infrastructure changes automatically from a Git repository.
   - **Steps**:
     - Set up a Git repository with Kubernetes manifests or Helm charts.
     - Use tools like ArgoCD or Flux to automatically apply changes to a Kubernetes cluster when changes are committed to the repository.

### 7. **Advanced Git Projects (Rebasing and Cherry-picking)**
   - **Goal**: Master advanced Git techniques like rebasing and cherry-picking.
   - **Steps**:
     - Use `git rebase` to rebase your changes onto another branch.
     - Use `git cherry-pick` to apply specific commits from one branch to another.
     - Resolve conflicts that arise during rebase and cherry-picking.

If you are looking for projects that involve multiple technologies (like Docker, Jenkins, AWS, etc.), we can extend these Git-based workflows into more complex DevOps or cloud-native setups.
