<h1>Git issues </h1>

### 1. **Merge Conflicts**
   - **Cause**: Occurs when multiple changes are made to the same part of a file and Git cannot resolve it automatically.
   - **Solution**:
     - Open the conflicting file, which will have markers like:
       ```plaintext
       <<<<<<< HEAD
       your changes
       =======
       conflicting changes
       >>>>>>> branch-name
       ```
     - Manually edit the file to retain the desired changes.
     - Once resolved, stage the file using `git add <filename>`.
     - Commit the merge with `git commit`.

### 2. **Detached HEAD**
   - **Cause**: Happens when you checkout a specific commit instead of a branch.
   - **Solution**:
     - Run `git checkout <branch-name>` to reattach the HEAD to a branch.

### 3. **Untracked Files**
   - **Cause**: Files in the working directory that are not being tracked by Git.
   - **Solution**:
     - Use `git add <file>` to start tracking the files or `git clean -f` to remove them if they are unnecessary.

### 4. **Forgot to Commit Changes**
   - **Cause**: You made changes and forgot to commit them, or pushed before committing.
   - **Solution**:
     - Run `git status` to check which files have been modified.
     - Use `git add` and `git commit` to stage and commit the changes.

### 5. **Overwritten Changes (git reset or force-push)**
   - **Cause**: Use of `git reset` or `git push --force` that overwrites the history.
   - **Solution**:
     - Check your reflog using `git reflog` to identify the lost commits.
     - Use `git cherry-pick <commit>` or `git reset --hard <commit>` to restore the changes.

### 6. **Large File Commit**
   - **Cause**: Accidentally committing a large file that exceeds the size limit.
   - **Solution**:
     - Remove the large file using `git rm <file>`.
     - Commit the removal and push the changes.

### 7. **Corrupted Repository**
   - **Cause**: Occurs due to improper shutdown, disk issues, or file corruption.
   - **Solution**:
     - Run `git fsck` to check for repository issues.
     - If there are problems with loose objects, try running `git gc --prune=now`.

### 8. **History Rewriting Issues (rebase)**
   - **Cause**: Errors during a `git rebase`, especially when there are conflicts.
   - **Solution**:
     - Abort the rebase using `git rebase --abort`.
     - Resolve any conflicts and then continue with `git rebase --continue`.
