<h1>What CI/CD tools have you worked with? Can you describe a pipeline you’ve built using Jenkins?</h1>

As a Build and Release Engineer with 1.5 years of experience and 3.5 years as a DevOps Engineer, you likely have experience with several CI/CD tools. Based on your background, Jenkins would be one of the prominent tools you might have worked with, considering its popularity in CI/CD pipelines.

### Jenkins Pipeline Example:
Here’s an example of a Jenkins pipeline you could describe:

**Use Case: Deploying a Python Application with Docker to AWS EKS**

**Pipeline Flow:**

1. **Source Code Management:**
   - **Git/GitHub Integration:** 
     - The pipeline starts with a code commit in GitHub. Jenkins is configured to poll the repository or use a webhook to trigger the pipeline when changes are detected in the `main` branch.

2. **Build Stage:**
   - **Docker Build:**
     - Jenkins uses a `Jenkinsfile` where the pipeline is defined as a scripted or declarative pipeline.
     - The Python application is packaged into a Docker image using a `Dockerfile` within the repository.
     - Example pipeline code:
       ```groovy
       stage('Build Docker Image') {
           steps {
               script {
                   docker.build('python-app:latest')
               }
           }
       }
       ```

3. **Testing Stage:**
   - **Unit Tests:**
     - Jenkins runs unit tests inside the Docker container to ensure the application works as expected.
     - Example:
       ```groovy
       stage('Run Unit Tests') {
           steps {
               script {
                   docker.image('python-app:latest').inside {
                       sh 'python -m unittest discover tests'
                   }
               }
           }
       }
       ```

4. **Push to Docker Hub:**
   - After a successful build and test, the image is tagged and pushed to Docker Hub for later deployment.
     ```groovy
     stage('Push to Docker Hub') {
         steps {
             script {
                 docker.withRegistry('https://registry.hub.docker.com', 'dockerhub-credentials') {
                     docker.image('python-app:latest').push('latest')
                 }
             }
         }
     }
     ```

5. **Infrastructure Provisioning with Terraform:**
   - **Terraform Integration:**
     - The next step is to provision or update infrastructure in AWS EKS using Terraform.
     - Jenkins runs a Terraform job that sets up the necessary Kubernetes cluster or updates it.
     - Example:
       ```groovy
       stage('Terraform Apply') {
           steps {
               script {
                   sh 'terraform init && terraform apply -auto-approve'
               }
           }
       }
       ```

6. **Deploy to AWS EKS:**
   - **Kubernetes Deployment:**
     - Once the image is pushed to Docker Hub and the infrastructure is ready, the pipeline deploys the application to the Kubernetes cluster on EKS.
     - Helm charts can be used for deployment.
     - Example:
       ```groovy
       stage('Deploy to EKS') {
           steps {
               script {
                   sh 'helm upgrade --install my-app ./helm-chart --set image.repository=python-app,image.tag=latest'
               }
           }
       }
       ```

7. **Notification and Cleanup:**
   - **Slack Notifications:**
     - You can integrate Jenkins with Slack or other communication tools to send notifications about the pipeline status.
   - **Clean Up:**
     - Optionally, you could remove old images or perform post-build cleanup to save storage and maintain a clean environment.

This example showcases various technologies like Docker, Helm, Terraform, AWS EKS, and Jenkins in a full CI/CD pipeline. Given your background in AWS and DevOps, it’s likely similar to something you have already implemented or can build on.
